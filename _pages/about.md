I am a dedicated and inquisitive scientist with over ten years of experience in project management and laboratory research. 


My work spans the de novo design of biological systems to bio-electronic or 3D printed interfaces, resulting in multiple publications and recognition in national/international projects. 


I have contributed to numerous successful grant proposals and thrive in collaborative environments that tackle ambitious scientific challenges.
