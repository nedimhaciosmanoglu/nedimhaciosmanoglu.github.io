  <p>I am a dedicated and inquisitive scientist with over ten years of experience in project management and laboratory research.</p>

  <p>My work spans the de novo design of biological systems to bio-electronic or 3D printed interfaces, resulting in multiple publications and recognition in national/international projects.</p>

  <p>I have contributed to numerous successful grant proposals and thrive in collaborative environments that tackle ambitious scientific challenges.</p>

  <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring musical genres, building DIY devices, and exploring nature.</p>
